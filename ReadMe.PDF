This Program is Using Nodes to create a sorted list .
My program is included sorted-list.h for header, a 
sorted-list.c, and main.c .

I debugged and fixed all the problems on sorted-list.h 
and sorted-list.c, but unfortunatly, I couldn't figure 
out 1 Error on my Main.c on Line(75). 

My Main.c is included 3 cases /
Case(1)- is going to look at the Int.
Case(2)- is going to look at the Double.
Case(3)- is going to look at the Strings.
Case(-1)- is generated for Quiting the program.
Default- is generated for Bad input Errors.
